# Questions To Ask When Hiring A Developer:

When hiring a developer there are three key questions one should ask in order to assess the indvidualâ€™s abilities. The questions to ask are: 
1) Which version control program do you use?
2) Which framework do you use? And 
3) Which unit testing program do you use? 

Then for each of the questions one should also ask what do you compare it to and why did you choose it? A qualified and capable developer should have clear answers to each of these questions.  Even if the interviewer is not knowledgeable of thes topics  

Another effective question to ask are what programming languages do you know.  A talented developed should know multiple languages and should be continuously learning the new emerging languages and honing their craft.

A great way to find a developer is to attend meetups. I have included the link to the Ruby on Rails NYC meetup page below.
